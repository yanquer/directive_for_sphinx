====================================
Directive For Sphinx
====================================

it is useful if you migrate from sphinx

now you can use these directives

- toctree
- function
- literalinclude

with return nothing (no handle)

for these roles:

- ref
- doc
- download

return raw message

I plan to complete the above corresponding actual functions in the later free time and add more instructions.
